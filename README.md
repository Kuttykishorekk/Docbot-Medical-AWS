# DocBot
I qualified to participate in a two-part program hosted by AWS. The first stage, "AWS Premium Support Summer School", provided intensive training in cloud computing fundamentals and Amazon's corporate culture. As part of a team project, we proposed a solution to a business challenge using AWS cloud technologies.
The second stage, "AWS Premium Support Winter School", involved the practical implementation of our proposed designs under mentorship from AWS professionals. We were able to execute our ideas and present the final product to an audience including mentors, managers and AWS site leadership. I was the leader of the winning Team.
